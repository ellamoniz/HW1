# HW 1 accessibilty 

This project required me to work with a website that had several issues. Some of the HTML code was faulty, so links did not do their job. Some necessary accessibility requirements were not met, and the style.CSS was full of redundancy. So I debugged, added, and removed content to improve accesibilty. Thankfully, in all aspects of society, we are working on making most things more accessible, and that extends into technology. 

## How to Work on Homework

### User Story

Part of being a developer is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience and imagining their experience with the application you’re creating. 

A user story, or persona, is a description of an application using natural, non-technical language. Written from the perspective of the application’s end user, they help developers organize their work by allowing them to understand an application’s context and who will be using it.

### Acceptance Criteria
